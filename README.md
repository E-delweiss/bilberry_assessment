Welcome to the Bilberry Assessment. This repository brings together my work on field/road classifier and a short overview of an AI paper which has brought (I think) a significant disruption on computer vision.

You'll find my main work in the root folder and the AI paper sumup here[ADD PATH]. Finally, I give an overview of one way to go further here[ADD PATH] by thinking about a challenge that the Bilberry's product might overcome.
